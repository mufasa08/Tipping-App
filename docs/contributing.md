# Contributing to TipJar
If you love this app and would like to contribute, please consider:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

1  If you have something to fix and it doesn't have an associated issue create that first using the Bugfix template.
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.(ktlint e.t.c)
7. Issue that pull request. Make sure to fill out the template correctly!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
You can fork and use the code but ensure you reference back to this repository. 

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/mufasa08/TipJar/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]() and selecting the template; it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use the [Kotlin Style Guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide)
